and **CPU** to calculate information

and finally the **output** devices that convert information to physical output

#### you here before about 1 & 0, Right?
One and zeros do play a big role in how computers work on the inside
Inside the computer are electric and wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer
How do we store or represent information using electricity
If we have a single wire with electricity flowing through it
The signal could either be on or off ,in the other word , we can represent  Yes or no , True or false, or one or zero < or anything else with only 2 option. This on/off state of a single wire is called a bit , and it is the smallest piece of the information a computer can store.
If you get one wires ,you get more bits, more ones and zeros
With more bits you can represent more complex information.
